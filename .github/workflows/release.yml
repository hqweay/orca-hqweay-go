          # Actually, 'conventional-changelog' is hard to make output JUST the new entry cleanly to stdout without context.
          # A better way for CI is using a dedicated action or script.
          # But since we have `CHANGELOG.md` in the repo (committed by update-version.sh), we can try to parse it?
          # Easier: Just use the git tag message or the commit message like before?
          # User wants "changelog" as description.
          # Let's try to grab the latest entry from CHANGELOG.md
          # Assuming structure:
          # ## [Version] ...
          # content...
          # ## [Old Version] ...
